PROJECTS

	Business card
		Platform: ESP8266
		Features
			AP mode when not recognizing the internet
				SSID: Jakob's business card
				Shows instructions (in Bootstrap or otherwise) when connected
				Asks for WiFi settings, name of person and phone number (first message: Welcome to Jakob's business card experience! Learn how to use it at smarter.engineering/card.)
		Hardware
			Button with single, double and longpress functions
			
			Motion sensor
			
			Distance sensor (if not too annoying with 5V)
			
			IR receiver
				Make old remote do anything:
					GET request (either normal or IFTTT)
					Text (random useful information).

	Multi-touch controls
		Three-finger drag: Rotate

	3D Model Viewer
		Like at link, but in 3D
			https://shop.everydayastronaut.com/products/coaster-set
		Drag to move around, centered on center point of product
		Laterz: Load 3D model from URL
		
	Document Viewer
		Load Word or PDF document, extract all pages as PNG and put as blocks.
		Tools:
			Maximize page to width - see nothing to the side of the page.
			Crop whitespace (either Python or at runtime with crop boxes) and all pages one below the other.
			See all exported images together as a group collage.
		Navigation:
			SpaceNavigator:
				Only X/Y, won't go further than corner of paper.
				buttons to go forward/back
			Keyboard:
				Previous/Next/Home/End, smoothly
				Up/Down on current page, smoothly
				If you reach bottom of page, a "Press space to go to the next page" box appears, doing what it says it does if you do what it asks you to do if you want it to do what it says it can do.
				. to get options dialog with nice, smoothly-sliding, color-changing toggle switches.
			Mouse:
				Drag or just move without clicking to pan in document, with different speeds as chosen in options dialog.
				Scroll to scroll smoothly, with different steps as chosen in options dialog.
			Options:
				Page turn speed
				Scroll speed, step
				
	Reklamsnuttar
		Återskapa videon på https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=53&v=A2heCLCR9Uw
		(via https://hermodcreationagency.com/inspirationshornan/, via Erik), som en sorts mall att kanske använda till examenspresentationen.
		
	PDF text extractor
		SpaceNavigate around in Document Viewer, drag boxes around areas you want to OCR, then do OCR with Python/whatever ShareX uses, save as text file and export to Kindle.
		Tools:
			Same selection on all/even/odd/every nth/specific pages
		
	Find the ball
		"Åh nej, Jonas hamnade i Babylons bibliotek!!! Hannes, Jessica och Josefine, leta reda på !"
		Animation showing the sun going up and down in smaller/larger circles, things popping up (already existing with visible clip plane moving up?)
		"Hannes har römt, hitta honom"
		"Jakob har flyttat" - zoom through random houses (different scene?) to next room
		"Jonas är upp-och-ner, nu var spelet slut" ... "... INTE! (same style as Spindelpojken och "
		One book gets teeth like in Harry Potter and eats another one, so they have to find a fourth one
		Books in order: bronze, silver, gold color (bronze gets eaten), then see-through.
		SW
			Loud noises when opening hall door
		Rick
			Note with devil ears and "Ask Google to turn on the lights" written on it. When asked, the outlet catches on fire - "Oj oj, här var det fulinstallation av el, det tycker inte Rick om, nu måste vi flytta"
		Deborah
		Finish
			Tally up the points, "Med 500 poäng säkrar Jonas en hedersvärd fjärdeplats"
			Cheers
			Point bars, camera moving from bottom to top so you don't know who got how many points until I announce it.
			Similar to "that's my girl", Melodifestivalen theme playing in the end with light spots moving like real ones do
			"Och nu till böckerna" where you couldn't previously see the title of the book
				Unwrap wrapping (possibly as Blender animation) to reveal actual book.
					One book is a Kindle Paperwhite.
				OR unwrap to reveal turned-off Kindles that need charging with "Hey Google, charge the Kindle" and the GH says "Ask Alexa." (with Alexa in room, 
			
	Find the ball - Finish with a twist
		Allow user to input numbers, possibly 3D object file, generate video and export for user to download as an MP4.
	Presentation
		Start from existing PowerPoint, export to image, find red things and export separately as "imageNumber-red", give depth and put above image.
		Put scriptableobject with slides and direction (1 to 6, right, or 6 to 3, left in descending order) where slides should be, mark gameObjects to show with scriptableobject containing length radius of camera and where it should look at object from, and whether it should rotate around the object as a step.
		Transitions either normal or like in Reuters Alexa news app (maybe only between normal slides and the models?)
	
SINE CURVED ANIMATION
	for(var i = 0; i < steps; i++){
		float sineMultiplier = ((1 - (Mathf.Cos(i / steps * Mathf.PI))) / 2);
		Vector3 dPos = oPos + diffPos * sineMultiplier;
		/*GameObject.*/transform.position = dPos;
		yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame();
	}
	
	void navigateInSpace()
    {
        float speed = 5f;
        transform.Translate(speed * SpaceNavigator.Translation, Space.Self);
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, speed * SpaceNavigator.Rotation.Yaw() * Mathf.Rad2Deg, Space.World);
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.right, speed * SpaceNavigator.Rotation.Pitch() * Mathf.Rad2Deg, Space.Self);
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.forward, speed * SpaceNavigator.Rotation.Roll() * Mathf.Rad2Deg, Space.Self);
    }

    {
        debugText.text = "Pos: "+transform.position.ToString() + "\nRot: " + transform.eulerAngles.ToString();
