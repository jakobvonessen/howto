Supervised learning:
	Regression - continuous value scale
	Classification - discrete values
	
Variables:
	m = number of training examples ("n")
	x_0 = 1
	
Make sure features are on a similar scale (e.g., 1-5 * 1000 ft^2, 3-4 rooms instead of 1000-5000 ft^2, 3-4 rooms)
	Want round-ish ellipticals for the contour plots of the cost function.	
	Rule of thumb: Get scale of values to between -1 and 1.
	Try to get average to 0, x_bedrooms = (#bedrooms - 2) / 5

	Not needed for normal equation

Use smaller alpha if convergence doesn't happen (if it diverges instead).
